Full sudo access: If you want to give Jenkins full access, add the following line. Replace jenkins with the appropriate user if different.
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


Restricted sudo access: If you want to restrict the commands that Jenkins can run, specify those commands instead. For example, to allow Jenkins to run /usr/bin/somecommand as any user without a password prompt, add:
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/somecommand      [like below]


Steps to Grant Jenkins Permissions for Docker and Ansible  To allow Jenkins to run Docker commands, youâ€™ll need to specify the Docker executable. If Docker is installed in /usr/bin/docker, you can add the following line:
# Allow Jenkins to run Docker commands
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/docker

# Allow Jenkins to run Ansible commands
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/ansible
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/ansible-playbook



Adding Jenkins to Docker and Ansible Groups
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo usermod -aG ansible jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
