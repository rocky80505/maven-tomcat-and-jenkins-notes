Steps to Configure SSH Access from Jenkins Master to Worker Machine


sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
   44  sudo touch /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
   45  chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
   46  sudo cp /home/ubuntu/staragile.pem /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
   47  chmod 600 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa 
   48  sudo -u jenkins ssh-keyscan -H 54.90.94.245 >> /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts  #it is publi ip of worker machine


1. Generate Public Key from the Private Key (if not already done)
If you don't have the public key (staragile.pub), you can generate it from the private key (staragile.pem) on the Jenkins Master:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -y -f /home/ubuntu/staragile.pem > /home/ubuntu/staragile.pub



2. Copy the Public Key to the Worker Machine
To allow Jenkins to connect to the worker machine, you need to add the public key to the authorized_keys file on the worker machine. Follow these steps:

Copy the Public Key to the Worker Machine:

You can copy the public key manually or use ssh-copy-id if you can access the worker machine with a password.

Manually Copy the Key:

Display the Public Key on Jenkins Master:

bash
Copy code


cat /home/ubuntu/staragile.pub
Copy the output of this command.

Log in to the Worker Machine:

If you can log in with another user or method, do so:

bash
Copy code

ssh ubuntu@34.228.11.87
Append the Public Key to authorized_keys:

On the worker machine:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
echo "paste-your-public-key-here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Replace "paste-your-public-key-here" with the content of staragile.pub you copied.


3. Verify SSH Access
On Jenkins Master, verify that Jenkins can SSH into the worker machine without requiring a password:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /home/ubuntu/staragile.pem ubuntu@34.228.11.87

You should be able to log in without being prompted for a password. If you can, Jenkins should also be able to use this key to connect as long as Jenkins is correctly configured to use the same private key.

4. Configure Jenkins
Ensure Jenkins is configured to use the private key for SSH connections. This usually involves:

Adding the SSH Key to Jenkins Credentials:

In Jenkins, navigate to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Credentials and add a new SSH key credential with the private key (staragile.pem).

Configuring Jenkins Jobs:

Ensure your Jenkins jobs are set to use the correct credentials when executing tasks that require SSH access to the worker machine.

Summary
Generate the public key if necessary.
Copy the public key to the authorized_keys file on the worker machine.
Verify that SSH access works from Jenkins Master to the worker machine.
Configure Jenkins to use the private key for SSH connections.
Following these steps should help you resolve the SSH connection issue between Jenkins and your worker machine.
